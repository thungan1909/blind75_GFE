The **Blind 75** is one of the most important sets of questions for data structure and algorithm style interviews.  

For DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) preparation, we recommend working through the Blind 75.  
Itâ€™s a concise list that effectively prepares you for core concepts and techniques.  

Many candidates use this list as a guide, focusing on each problem to strengthen their problem-solving skills.  
Weâ€™ve solved these questions in **JavaScript/TypeScript**, making them especially accessible for front-end engineers.
