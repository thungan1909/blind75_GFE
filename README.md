Most important 75 questions for data structure and algorithm style interviews.

For data structures and algorithms (DSA) questions, we recommend working through the Blind 75, a concise list that effectively prepares you for these topics.
Many candidates use this list as a guide, focusing on each problem to grasp core concepts and techniques. We've solved these questions in JavaScript/TypeScript to make them accessible to front end engineers.
