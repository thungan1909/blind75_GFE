## Definition of Balanced
A string is considered balanced if:

1. Each opening bracket is closed by the same type of bracket  
   - Example: `(` with `)`, `{` with `}`, `[` with `]`

2. Open brackets are closed in the correct order  
   - Example: `([])` is valid, but `([)]` is not

3. Any subset of brackets enclosed within a matched pair must also form a valid matched pair  
   - Example: `{[(])}` is **not balanced** because the contents inside `{` and `}` are unbalanced.

---

## Input
- `str: string` â€“ A string containing only the characters `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `[` and `]`.

---

## Output
- Return `true` if the string is balanced.  
- Return `false` otherwise.
