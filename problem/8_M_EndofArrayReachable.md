# End of Array Reachable

Given an array of integers `numbers` where each element in the array represents the maximum number of positions that can be moved forward from that index; it is acceptable to move by fewer positions.

Determine whether it is possible to reach the last index of the array by starting from the first index. Return `true` if it can be reached and `false` otherwise.

---

## Input
- `numbers: number[]` â€“ An array of integers, each index's value is the maximum number of positions reachable from that index.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**  
`numbers = [4,1,0,0,2,3]`  
**Output:**  
`true`  
**Explanation:**  
Move from index 0 to 4, then move 1 position to the last index.

---

### Example 2
**Input:**  
`numbers = [1,0,0,0]`  
**Output:**  
`false`  
**Explanation:**  
Can only move from index 0 to index 1 and no further movements thereafter, so it is impossible to reach the last index.

---

### Example 3
**Input:**  
`numbers = [2,3,1,1,4]`  
**Output:**  
`true`  
**Explanation:**  
Move 1 position forward from index 0 to index 1 (it is allowed to move up to 2 positions, but going to index 1 first allows us to move further). From index 1, move 3 positions to reach the last index.

## Constraints
- `1 <= numbers.length <= 10,000`  
- `0 <= numbers[i] <= 100,000`
