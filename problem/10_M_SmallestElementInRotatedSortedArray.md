## Problem

Given a **sorted and rotated array** `numbers` containing unique elements, find and return the **minimum element** in this array.

Rotating an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` once results in `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.  
Rotating it a second time results in `[a[n-2], a[n-1], a[0], a[1], ..., a[n-3]]`.

Develop an algorithm that runs in **O(log n)** time complexity.

## Input

- `numbers: number[]` â€” an array of integers

---

## Examples

Input: `numbers = [1,2,3,4]`  
Output: `1`  
Explanation: The original array `[1,2,3,4]` was rotated 0 times.  

Input: `numbers = [3,4,1,2]`  
Output: `1`  
Explanation: The original array `[1,2,3,4]` was rotated 2 times.  

Input: `numbers = [6,7,8,-5,-4,2]`  
Output: `-5`  
Explanation: The original array `[-5,-4,2,6,7,8]` was rotated 3 times.

## Constraints

- `1 <= numbers.length <= 1000`  
- `-10,000 <= numbers[i] <= 10,000`
