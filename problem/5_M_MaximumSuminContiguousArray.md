## Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `numbers`, determine the subarray that has the highest sum and return that sum.

A subarray is a contiguous segment of an array where all elements are taken from consecutive indices, preserving their order, such as `[2, 3]` in `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.  
Non-contiguous selections like `[1, 3]` are **not valid** subarrays.

## Input
- `numbers: number[]` â†’ An array of integers.

## Examples

**Example 1**  
Input: numbers = [-1, 5, -3, 9, -11]  
Output: 11  
Explanation: The subarray `[5, -3, 9]` has the largest sum i.e `11`.

**Example 2**  
Input: numbers = [9]  
Output: 9  
Explanation: The single-element subarray `[9]` has the largest sum i.e `9`.

**Example 3**  
Input: numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]  
Output: 10  
Explanation: The subarray `[1, 2, 3, 4]` has the largest sum i.e `10`.

## Constraints
- `1 <= numbers.length <= 10,000`  
- `-10,000 <= numbers[i] <= 10,000`
