## Problem Statement
Given the root node of a **binary tree**, flip the tree by swapping each node's **left** and **right** children, then return the root of the flipped tree.  

The binary tree is represented by a collection of `TreeNode`s, where each node has optional left and right child nodes.

---

## Input
- **root:** `TreeNode` â†’ Root node of the tree. (Examples use level-order traversal of the tree)  

### TreeNode interface
```ts
interface TreeNode {
  val: number;
  left: TreeNode | null;
  right: TreeNode | null;
}
```

## Examples
- Example 1:
Input: root = [2,1,3]  
Output: [2,3,1]  
Explanation: The left and right children are swapped.  

- Example 2:
Input: root = [43,null,-55]  
Output: [43,-55]  
Explanation: The right child becomes the left child after inversion.  

- Example 3:
Input: root = [12,8,18,6,null,null,20]  
Output: [12,18,8,20,null,null,6]  
Explanation: The tree is inverted, with left and right children of each node being swapped.  


## Constraints
- 1 <= Number of nodes <= 100
- -100 <= TreeNode.val <= 100
