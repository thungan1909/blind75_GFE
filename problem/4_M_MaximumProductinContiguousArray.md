## Problem

Given an array of integers `numbers`, determine the subarray that has the highest product and return that product.

A subarray is a contiguous segment of an array where all elements are taken from consecutive indices, preserving their order, such as `[2, 3]` in `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.  
Non-contiguous selections like `[1, 3]` are **not valid** subarrays.

---

## Input
- `numbers: number[]` → An array of integers.

---

## Notes
- The test cases are designed such that the result will fit within a 32-bit integer.
- The product of any prefix or suffix of `numbers` is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

## Examples

**Example 1**  
Input:  numbers = [1, 2, -3, 5, 1]
Output:  5
Explanation: The subarray `[5, 1]` has the largest product i.e `5`.

---

**Example 2**  
Input:  numbers = [9]
Output:  9
Explanation: The single-element subarray `[9]` has the largest product i.e `9`.

---

**Example 3**  
Input:  
numbers = [1, 2, 0, -1, 8, -4]
Output:  32

Explanation: The subarray `[-1, 8, -4]` has the largest product i.e `32`.

---

## Constraints
- `1 <= numbers.length <= 1000`  
- `-10 <= numbers[i] <= 10`
