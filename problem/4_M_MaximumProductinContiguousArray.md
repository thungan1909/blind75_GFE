**Difficulty:** ðŸŸ¡ Medium

## Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `numbers`, determine the subarray that has the highest product and return that product.

A subarray is a contiguous segment of an array where all elements are taken from consecutive indices, preserving their order, such as `[2, 3]` in `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.  
Non-contiguous selections like `[1, 3]` are **not valid** subarrays.

---

## Input
- **numbers:** `number[]` â†’ An array of integers  

---

## Notes
- The test cases are designed such that the result will fit within a 32-bit integer.  
- The product of any prefix or suffix of `numbers` is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

## Examples
```text
- Example 1:
Input: numbers = [1, 2, -3, 5, 1]
Output: 5
Explanation: The subarray [5, 1] has the largest product i.e 5.

- Example 2:
Input: numbers = [9]
Output: 9
Explanation: The single-element subarray [9] has the largest product i.e 9.

- Example 3:
Input: numbers = [1, 2, 0, -1, 8, -4]
Output: 32
Explanation: The subarray [-1, 8, -4] has the largest product i.e 32.
```
## Constraints
- 1 <= numbers.length <= 1000
- -10 <= numbers[i] <= 10
