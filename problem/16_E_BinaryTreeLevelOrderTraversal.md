**Difficulty:** ðŸŸ¢ Easy

## Problem Statement
Given the root node of a **binary tree**, return an array of arrays, where each inner array represents the values of nodes at each level of the tree, traversed from **left to right**.  

The binary tree is represented by a collection of `TreeNode`s, where each node has optional left and right child nodes.

---

## Input
- **root:** `TreeNode` â†’ Root node of the tree. (Examples use level-order traversal of the tree)  

### TreeNode interface
```ts
interface TreeNode {
  val: number;
  left: TreeNode | null;
  right: TreeNode | null;
}
```

## Examples
```ts
- Example 1:
Input: root = [13,null,-55]  
Output: [[13],[-55]]  
Explanation: The root has two levels: the first level with the value 13, and the second level with the value -55.  

- Example 2:
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]  
Output: [[1],[2,3],[4,5,6,7]]  
Explanation: The tree has three levels: [1] at the first level, [2, 3] at the second level, and [4, 5, 6, 7] at the third level.  

- Example 3:
Input: root = [5,3,8,null,4,7,9]  
Output: [[5],[3,8],[4,7,9]]  
Explanation: The tree has three levels: [5] at the first level, [3, 8] at the second level, and [4, 7, 9] at the third level.  
```
## Constraints:
- 1 <= Number of nodes <= 10,000
- -100 <= TreeNode.val <= 100
