## Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `numbers` and a number `k`, find the `k` most frequent numbers in the array.  
Here, `k` represents the number of elements that should be returned, which are the ones that appear the most frequently.  
The order of the result does not matter.

---

## Input
- **numbers:** `number[]` â†’ An array of integers  
- **k:** `number` â†’ An integer  

---

## Examples
```text
- Example 1:
Input: numbers = [4,4,4,6,6,5,5,5], k = 2
Output: [4,5]
Explanation: The two most frequent numbers are 4 and 5, as they appear the most often in the array.

- Example 2:
Input: numbers = [7,7,7,8,8,9,9,9], k = 3
Output: [7,9,8]
Explanation: The three most frequent numbers are 7, 9, and 8.

- Example 3:
Input: numbers = [10,10,10,10,10], k = 1
Output: [10]
Explanation: Since there is only one unique number, 10, it is the most frequent.
```

##  Constraints:
- 1 <= numbers.length <= 1000
- -10,000 <= numbers[i] <= 10,000
- 1 <= k <= Number of unique elements in numbers
- The solution is guaranteed to have a unique result
